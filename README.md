**Proposed Level of Achievement: Apollo 11**

## **Motivation**

Living in a society where there is a constant demand for extra academic tuition, one Google search for the keyword “tuition” would return search results on numerous tuition agencies.  Tuition agencies connect Parents to Tutors, via their tuition-matching system. Their business model mainly derives revenue from taking a cut from the tuition fees paid to the Tutor, meaning the Parent does not need to pay any extra fees. 

Many parents may find the whole experience of seeking tuition for their children an inconvenient one because:

Users typically fill up a form based on minimal preferences and then get matched to a tutor by the agency thereafter. They face imperfect information since the profiles of tutors are not showcased beforehand and they have no autonomy over the selection of tutors for the tutees.
Webpages merely consist of forms to fill up their contact information and preferences, a largely boring experience that lacks an interactive and user-centric interface.

Target Audience and Features that will apply to them: 
Parents 
Simple, easy and user-friendly way picking suitable tutors for their children 
Enjoy a more tailored and efficient process
Have filters and preferences they can easily change to suit their needs 
Students (12 and above)  
Take the initiative to use the app themselves instead their parents due to the attractive gamification features 
Enjoy a more tailored and efficient process
Have filters and preferences they can easily change to suit their needs 
Tutors 
Having signed up for existing tuition matching platforms as a tutor before, we also realized that there is a lack of support for tutors. We want to help tutors track their tutoring progress and support their tutoring endeavors as well.


## **Aim**

We aim to create a comprehensive tuition-matching mobile application that can facilitate an efficient and interactive matching process for both tutors and tutees.


## **User Stories**

- As a parent who wants to look for tuition for my child, I want to ensure that I can choose a suitable tutor catered to my preferences that I can change anytime

- As a student who wants to look for tuition, I want to choose a suitable tutor for myself through a smooth and convenient process at affordable rates.

- As a tutor who wants to look for tutees, I want to readily find students through a fuss-free process.

- As a tutor who wants to have a recurring pool of tutees, I want to be supported with the right resources for this career.

## **Scope of Project**

BrainWaves is a comprehensive tuition application catering to both tutors and clients looking for tutors. It provides clients who are looking for tutors an efficient and interactive process through a clean and minimalistic user interface.

Clients are able to swipe right and left on tutor cards to indicate their interests for suitable tutors. Tutor cards only display essential information for clients to consider: Gender, experience, type of tutor (Full-time/Part-time). Tutors are able to view all the clients who have swiped right on them and choose to accept these clients.

Potential tutors are able to kickstart or enhance their tutoring career on our platform. This is through the gamification of different levels and experience points for different tutors based on their tutoring experience, academic qualifications as well as their ratings. The higher the level, the better prospects each tutor has and they can consistently keep track of them on our platform.


## **Features**

Our key features include:

Profile Creation (Tutors & Tutees)
When opening the application, the user will be asked to choose between 2 options to classify themselves as a tutor or a tutee. Each user type will experience different app navigations.
Once the user type has been established, the user will be required to login or to sign up for an account. For existing users whose accounts are registered in our database, they can proceed to login to their accounts.
For tutors who are signing up for accounts, different types of information will be gathered from them.

## *Database*


Through firebase, we will be creating the databases required to store:
User profiles
User preferences

We will be using the database and running algorithms to curate the most appropriate tutors to tutees according to criteria such as geographical region or other preferences.

## *Tutor Selection*

To gamify the user interface, tutees would then be given all the curated tutor profile cards in a tinder carousel format where they can swipe left or right to indicate their interest for suitable tutors. Tutor cards would consist of photos, subject expertise, tutoring rates and geographical locations.

Tutees will still be able to customize preferences of the tutor regarding various things such as subject, their qualification, their price range, location, former schools (could be more beneficial to choosing their own alumni etc) in their settings tab.

Once a tutor is swiped right on, they will receive a notification asking them to decline or accept the offer. The parent/tutee will be notified and will be sent a confirmation agreement as 
reflected in Diagram 1 below. Once confirmed, they will then unlock access to each other’s numbers to make arrangements for their tuition schedules.
